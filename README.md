# Genre-Classification-IMDbDataset
This report is based on the dataset from a competition on the Kaggle website, which challenges people to analyze and build a classification model that classifies the genre of a movie by its description. For this dataset we are working on, it required us to build and train three different classification models, but also to put our hands on text data preprocessing for the first time. The primary dataset is released by the Genre Classification Dataset IMDb and our dataset has been prepared and simplified with only partial covariates of the original dataset by Simon Zhou. Several different approaches have been done and the four models with the highest scores are presented. They are BERT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Naive Bayes
